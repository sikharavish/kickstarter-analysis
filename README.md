# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
> Uncovering trends from the kickstarter data
## Overview of the project
**Purpose & Background** </br>
  Louiseâ€™s play **Fever** came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.</br>
  The huge data is good but it would not help unless some actions are performed on the data.These actions lead in identifying the trend and thus helping the individual in making a data driven decision.
## Analysis & Challenges
**Analysis** </br>
The analysis of the data without knowing the right tools is really tough and not worth the effort.</br>
The huge dataset relating to the kickstarters across the world cannot be insightful unless this data is processed. In order to process this data, the data format has to be ensured is in the correct order. Ex: Date format was not in correct order. This is a common problem so as an analyst I need to ensure that the data is cleaned and is in good shape.</br>
Further applying the pivot table logic on the data further helped me in identifying the hidden data points. For this excercise, it was limited to **Theater** . However, there are so many hidden trends which can be extracted to conclude in a meaningful way.</br>

## Results
The Results reflect the action that be performed on the data after this effort. </br>

### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date </br>
  This clearly showes what is needed when preparing the big launch. There are 2 outcomes that need a special focus </br>
  1. The best time to launch the Theater which provides maximum collection </br>
  2. October month has no cancellations, so if anything special needs to be performed then it would be very ideal time.</br>

### Outcomes based on Goals </br>
The 2 outcomes of this launch are: </br>
1. Most of the successful Theater are handled for cost less than $1000 USD </br>
2. Most of hte failed Theater's are the one's with launch cost of greater than $50,000 USD </br>

### Limitations of the dataset </br>
- The genere, ethnicity of the play is not considered </br>
- The duration of the show is also not taken into account. The data is unable to share if the play being <$1000 USD and <1 hr.
